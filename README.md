,`*DOMAIN QUESTIONNAIRE*`,

1. List 10 available domains (use http://iwantmyname.com) you think would be appropriate for your site:

 1.http://singinskeletons.com
 2.http://skeletunes.com
 3.http://skeletones.com
 4.http://justsomeskeletonshanginout.com
 5.http://bonesandtones.com
 6.http://skelesongs.com
 7.http://spookytunes.com
 8.http://scarybonetones.com
 9.http://skeletonlounge.com
 10.http://spookyserenades.com
  
2. What type or genre of domain is this? (Ex. Game, Toy, Greeting Card Generator, Creative Tool, Political Pamphlet, Archive)

  Toy
  
3. Write a small story (one paragraph or so) that details a user's experience of discovering your domain, visiting it within a particular context (like mobile, desktop, while hungry, at a funeral, etc.), experiencing what it has to offer, and subsequently leaving.

 My website is intended to be viewed in a laptop/desktop context only, in that it won't be designed or modified in a mobile context. There are three scenarios where someone could happen upon my website. One would be that it had been archived in a certain category with other similar websites, such as www.theuselessweb.com (where it would most likely end up). Another is if someone happens to be googling about singing skeletons. And third would be if it somehow became popular on tumblr. Ideally I would like the user to play around for at least 10 seconds before moving on. 
  
4. Would somebody return to your domain after visiting it for the first time - in how long do you think - and why?

  Maybe for a minute or two. 
  
5. List some 'stuff' that your site 'does'. (Be detailed)

  My site will display a grid of skeleton gifs. When one hovers over the image of the skeleton, the gif will play. When the user clicks and holds the mouse, a note will play. There will be 24 skeletons for 3 octaves.
